### Title: Open Innovation in the Air Force: Are Changes to R\&D Application Processes Lowering Barriers and Drawing a New Crowd?

### By: Charlie Chimento

### Abstract: This work focuses on AFWERX's radical restructuring of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which funds small business research efforts that have the potential to benefit national security and commercialize into useful products generally. Due to concern that administrative overhead prevents small, yet innovative companies from applying, AFWERX introduced three new application channels, hereafter referred to as Special, Open, and Pitch Days. This visualization compares the types of companies applying to these new application channels to the conventional channel running concurrently. The data consists of over 10,000 applications to Air Force SBIR from 2016 through 2019, with matched financial data from PitchBook. A timeline traces and explains the evolution of the AFWERX innovation ecosystem in addition to the policy reforms directly to SBIR. A separate pane allows the viewer to compare distributions of the company size of the applicants between the novel application channel and the conventional channel. Particularly striking are results that show the Special channel is attracting smaller companies.

### Commentary on Project Process: Originally, I wanted to have a tree that showed the different application channels, because in reality the distinction between Special, Open, and Pitch Days is oversimplified. With seven parameters, the application channels can be uniquely identified. But for each solicitation period there is a new set of application channels available, so I wanted to the application tree to update for each solicitation period, before having a pane that allows comparisons between companies. With over a hundred company features I opted to focus on company size because the intent of the program was to draw smaller companies previously prevented from applying because of administrative overhead. While the mean, max and min values give an idea for how applicant pools differ, a distribution really gives the most information and is visually interesting. A violin plot was decided upon because it allows for comparison across different levels of a factor, and a lot of factors were available. Although not completed, it was also intended to freeze the viz (result of lots of filtering options) and compare it with another laid on top with lesser opacity.
